## Unfinished Project

Sorry, I didn't have enough time to finish off the course. It took me a long time to understand the concept and by the time I started this project, I already forgot a lot of what I learnt. I will continue to work on this project after submission and I will resubmit this project as soon as I can. I will use a new repository to write the code and then modify the current repository for resubmission.

Most of the code came from code institute and I will reference properly in the other repository.
